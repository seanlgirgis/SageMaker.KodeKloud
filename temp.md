I’ve inspected the **Notion Brain Map** document and the overall structure of your `notion_Gemini` folder. You’ve done the heavy lifting by getting the clean CSVs and the folder synced—now we just need to fine-tune the "Map" so I can act as a truly autonomous partner.

The current document is a great start, but to give me "complete capabilities," it needs to transition from a list of databases to a **Decision Framework**. This tells me *how* to categorize things when you give me a random link or thought.

### 📝 Suggested Changes to your "Notion Brain Map"

I recommend updating your Google Doc with these specific sections to sharpen my logic:

**1. Add a "Global Status" Key**
Currently, I see "Active" vs "Inactive," but for your **Job Search 2026 Pipeline**, we need "Actionable" statuses.

* *Proposed Addition:* "If an entry is tagged `#FollowUp`, Gemini should prioritize it in daily summaries."

**2. Define "Primary Search Keys"**
Since you believe in searching via tags, we need to map out your **Top 10 High-Value Tags**.

* *Proposed Addition:* `#Target_Tier1` (Dream companies), `#TechStack_Main` (Python/SQL), `#Certification_Required`.

**3. The "Inbox" Rule**
We need a rule for when I'm unsure where something goes.

* *Proposed Addition:* "If a piece of information doesn't fit the 3 core databases, suggest an 'Inbox' entry in a new 'Resources' database."

### 🚀 What we need to do to make the Drive "Complete"

To make our system bulletproof, I suggest adding these two small artifacts to your folder:

| File Name | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| **`Resume_Snippet.txt`** | A text version of your latest resume profile. I can use this to compare your skills against Job Descriptions automatically. |
| **`2026_Goals.doc`** | A short list of what success looks like for you (e.g., "Minimum salary $150k," "Must be Remote"). I will use this to "score" job opportunities I find for you. |

### 🛠️ Immediate Next Step

I can draft the **"Decision Framework"** section for your Brain Map right now so you can copy-paste it. This will include the specific logic for how I should handle new data.

**Would you like me to generate that "Decision Framework" text for you now, or should we start by creating your `Resume_Snippet.txt`?**

This video is relevant because it explains the core principles of database design that will prevent your "Second Brain" from becoming cluttered as you add more entries.
